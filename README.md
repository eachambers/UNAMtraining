# UNAM training course

In this course, we'll go from obtaining raw ddRADseq data to building basic phylogenies and data visualization. Many of these materials have been borrowed/modified from other existing materials. I always cite (or link, when applicable) the source of such materials.

Calendar of events during your stay can be found here.
